### Create diplomas

| **Description** | **Power Automate** |
|:-----:|:---------------:|
|As a trigger for this flow we will use a Microsoft form, so we start by creating one.|    In Microsoft Forms   ![Microsoft Form](https://github.com/laurasalvadorglez/Automations/blob/main/Assets/form1.png)         |
|**To find the identifier execute the flow, and go to the outputs in "Get response details" there, in body, you will find the identifier, it will look like this: "r430a1759d1734798a85fd621869aedf6"** |   ![form identifier](https://github.com/laurasalvadorglez/Automations/blob/main/Assets/id.png)         |
|**To create the schema, we go to the executed flow and copy the specified address (Without the square brackets.)** |   ![Parse json](https://github.com/laurasalvadorglez/Automations/blob/main/Assets/json2.png)         |
|Add 2 Parse Json, and configure them with the previous steps.|       ![json](https://github.com/laurasalvadorglez/Automations/blob/main/Assets/json.png)      |
|Add a ‚ÄúGet file content‚Äù to save the Excel information.|       ![json](https://github.com/laurasalvadorglez/Automations/blob/main/Assets/getfile.png)      |
|To verify that there are the same number of files as rows in the excel. |         ![Number of files 1](https://github.com/laurasalvadorglez/Automations/blob/main/Assets/numfiles.png)       |
|We add a condition so that, if there is a mismatch, the technician is notified and the flow is stopped.|         ![Number of files 2](https://github.com/laurasalvadorglez/Automations/blob/main/Assets/numfiles2.png)       |
|Create the table so the flow can read the excel.|       ![json](https://github.com/laurasalvadorglez/Automations/blob/main/Assets/creartabla.png)      |
|We add 2 actions that create the folders of signed and unsigned, named with the course identifier. In parallel an error message in case the creation of the table fails. |       ![json](https://github.com/laurasalvadorglez/Automations/blob/main/Assets/carpetas.png)      |
|Create an Apply to Each and add a Parse Json with the json schema of the Excel row |       ![Apply to each](https://github.com/laurasalvadorglez/Automations/blob/main/Assets/applyto.png)      |
|We fill a Word file with the information of an Excel row. And add a Create File because otherwise the filled Word is not saved. <sub> NOTE: When indicating the tag to be filled in Word, we have the problem that even if it is named the same way in different templates, the Word internal identifier changes. Therefore, the only solution found so far has been to copy and paste the tag from one template to another before sending it in the form. </sub> |       ![Populate](https://github.com/laurasalvadorglez/Automations/blob/main/Assets/populate.png)      |



### Sending diplomas to the students of a course

|:-----:|:---------------:|
|As a trigger for this flow we will use a Microsoft form, so we start by creating one.|    In Microsoft Forms   ![Microsoft Form](https://github.com/laurasalvadorglez/Automations/blob/main/Assets/form.png)         |
|Add the trigger and the action ‚ÄúGet response details‚Äù.|       ![Microsoft Form](https://github.com/laurasalvadorglez/Automations/blob/main/Assets/form2.png)        |
|Create a Parse Json for the excel (the file we will attach to the form) and add a ‚ÄúGet file content‚Äù.|     ![3rd step](https://github.com/laurasalvadorglez/Automations/blob/main/Assets/3.png)          |
|Create the table so the flow can read the excel|         ![Create table](https://github.com/laurasalvadorglez/Automations/blob/main/Assets/converttable1.png)       |
|To verify that there are the same number of files as rows in the excel.|         ![Number of files 1](https://github.com/laurasalvadorglez/Automations/blob/main/Assets/numfiles.png)       |
|We add a condition so that, if there is a mismatch, the technician is notified and the flow is stopped.|         ![Number of files 2](https://github.com/laurasalvadorglez/Automations/blob/main/Assets/numfiles2.png)       |
|We initialize the variables in order to create the next block.|         ![Variables](https://github.com/laurasalvadorglez/Automations/blob/main/Assets/variables.png)       |
|Now we make a second check. This time, we check that each Excel row has its respective document.|         ![Check names](https://github.com/laurasalvadorglez/Automations/blob/main/Assets/checknames.png)       |
|We create an Apply to each where we make a row comparison with the file names.|         ![Check names 2](https://github.com/laurasalvadorglez/Automations/blob/main/Assets/checknames2.png)       |
|We create another comparison, in which if ‚ÄúMissing files‚Äù is true it sends a message to the technician with the name of the missing file and stops the flow. |         ![Check names 3](https://github.com/laurasalvadorglez/Automations/blob/main/Assets/checknames3.png)       |
|Start a variable to store the documents |         ![Initialize variable](https://github.com/laurasalvadorglez/Automations/blob/main/Assets/Initvar.png)       |
|Start the for each. We add a Parse Json and the action of Get file content using path.|      ![For Each 1](https://github.com/laurasalvadorglez/Automations/blob/main/Assets/ForEach1.png)         |
|Name the variable created before|      ![Name var](https://github.com/laurasalvadorglez/Automations/blob/main/Assets/ForEach2.png)         |
|Configure the sending of emails.|      ![Emails](https://github.com/laurasalvadorglez/Automations/blob/main/Assets/ForEach3.png)         |
|Finally, add 2 actions, one to write in the channel that the process has been carried out correctly and the other to notify the technician if there has been an error|      ![End](https://github.com/laurasalvadorglez/Automations/blob/main/Assets/end.png)         |
